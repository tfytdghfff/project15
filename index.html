      <h1>Achivements</h1>
      <p>The Annual Report showcases the achievements and glories of our school, 
        undoubtedly, but also makes us think deeply about our shortcomings. We 
        have always been committed to create an environment in the school which 
        helps the young minds to blossom and provide a platform for individual 
        thinking and holistic development of the child’s personality.
        We set standards and goals for ourselves and strive to achieve them –
        be it in the area of academics, sports, discipline, leadership and more.
        Each year, SLOKA holds the Annual Prize Distribution Ceremony to honour 
        those of its students who have made the school proud with their brilliant 
        efforts not only in the academic field but also in the co-curricular areas.
        I wish to begin with our performance on the academic front. 
        Achieving academic excellence is at the heart of our endeavour as 
        educators. Academic achievements reflect a demonstrated ability to 
        perform to the best of one’s ability by developing one’s intellectual 
        potentials and skills with diligence and ardour. We are happy to share the 
        details of the commendable performances of our students of Classes LKG to 
        VIII.
        “To be a great champion, you must believe you are the best. If you are 
        not, keep on trying.”
        Sports competitions inculcate the spirit of positive challenges & 
        sportsmanship among the students and prepare them for the life ahead. 
        Sports, Games and Physical Fitness occupy a place of importance in our 
        curriculum. Our students actively participated in different sports 
        competitions and won medals, certificates and trophies.
        Various Co-Curricular Activities are held under different Clubs to 
        develop a child physically, morally, socially and mentally and to hone skills 
        in co-scholastic areas. Regular Club Activities are held in which the 
        students participate and display their caliber.
        The different Clubs are Musical, Dance & Drama Club, Sports Club, Art 
        and Craft Club, Excursion & Picnic Club, Language & Expression Club, 
        Classical & Instrumental Club, Eco Club, Exhibition Club and Hobby Club.
        In keeping with the school’s policy of continuous upgradation of 
        knowledge and skills, our teachers attended various workshops and 
        seminars organized by the school and others so as to improve their 
        academic transaction skills and to update their capabilities.
        Many milestones have been achieved and many still have to be 
        reached. We at SLOKA will continue our unceasing efforts to mould the 
        young minds into well balanced personalities with confidence and zeal 
        befitting the standards of this portal of education.
        On this memorable occasion as we recount our success with pride 
        and happiness, we wish to dedicate all our achievements to the committed 
        effort of a committed team called Sloka School. We humbly salute our 
        visionary leaders of the past and the great ones of the present and seek 
        divine grace and blessings to guide us in all our endeavors.
        Finally our report concludes by quoting our Motto “Everything in 
        Education go beyond”</p>
